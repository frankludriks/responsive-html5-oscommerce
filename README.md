Responsive HTML5 osCommerce
===========================

This version been built on @haraldpdl osCommerce version 2.3.3.4. For more information about osCommerce visit them at http:www.oscommerce.com or 
find them on Github at https://github.com/osCommerce/oscommerce2.

I've made osCommerce responsive by removing the default 960gs.css and adding @nathansmith 's Unsemantic CSS Framwork https://github.com/nathansmith/unsemantic
Read the documentation at his web site http://unsemantic.com 

This software is intended to be used as a starting point for DIY'ers to build themselves a responsive online osCommerce store.

Tbe best tool to use to view the site through various devices is is Malte Wassermann' Responsive Design Testing Tools http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/
Simply create bookmarklets and view the site.

There is still quite a bit of work to be done but this will more than likely vary depending on the users needs.
