Responsive HTML5 osCommerce
===========================

This version been built on Harald Ponce de Leon's osCommerce version 2.3.3.4. For more information about osCommerce visit them at http:www.oscommerce.com or find them on Github at https://github.com/osCommerce/oscommerce2.

I've made osCommerce responsive by removing the default 960gs.css and adding Nathan Smith's Unsemantic CSS Framwork https://github.com/nathansmith/unsemantic. Read the full documentation at his web site http://unsemantic.com. 

This software is intended to be used as a starting point for DIY'ers to build themselves a responsive online osCommerce store. If you do find this software useful and you do make changes that improves the responsiveness of the site - pelase let me know so that I can implement those changes for the benefit of others.

View a working demo: http://responsiveoscommerce.webwolf.co.za/ -  The demo will also serve as my personal sandbox so you may at times see a bit of code and dust flying around.

Tbe best tool to use to view the demo is Malte Wassermann' Responsive Design Testing Tools http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/ - Simply create yourself a set of bookmarklets and view the site.

There is still quite a bit of work to be done but this will more than likely vary depending on the users needs so at this point and time, it's virtually impossible to determine and to provide support for all scenarios.
